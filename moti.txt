#appreciationpost 

After intense 8 weeks time at Tata Consultancy Services and being part of the Grow TCS program, today was our last day or so called the "Graduation Day". 



Starting from day one wondering as to which path to opt for and how would be the working environment, but happily TCS supports and motivates more multi culture environment that helped me to understand the working style of different European countries. Meeting people from different nationalities and working on a same project helped me to understand their approach of solving a complex task.



In addition to that having best guides Sapthagiri Chapalapalli, Palanivetrivelan Jayabalan, Narmadha Kamalakannan, Pankaj Mishra and Namrata Borah provided me and the trainees the best path as to how to work in an industrial surrounding and which factors must be inherited to be a better person. 



Big thank you to all my trainee friends/colleagues that encouraged the process of knowledge sharing during the task periods and calling the product output as not an individual effort but rather a "team effort". This appreciation was for all trainees as we all are #onetcser.



Lastly, was very touched by the line from one of our global leaders that "No one is ever gonna be perfect, keep inspiring yourself and continuously improving yourself".
